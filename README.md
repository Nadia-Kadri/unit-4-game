# What the project does
This project tests your math skills! The computer generates a random target number at the start of the game as well as generating random numbers for the four crystals on the screen. When you click on a crystal the random number assigned to the crystal is added to your count. The aim of the game is to match your count to the target number. If you match it, you win! if you go over, you lose!
